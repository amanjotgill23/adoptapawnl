# Adopt a Paw NL

This is my first time designing a complete website myself from start to finish. I started this about 4 weeks into learning HTML, CSS and Javascript through Get Coding NL.

Currently I have the basic index.html page containing a link to the website logo and a few navigation menu items. I will be adding styling and more context to the pages in the next commit.
