# Adopt a Paw NL

This is my first time designing a complete website myself from start to finish. I started this about 4 weeks into learning HTML, CSS and Javascript through Get Coding NL.

Changelog for this project:

1. Added basic index.html page containing a link to the website logo and a few navigation menu items without any styling. Created empty html files for other pages on website and an empty CSS file.

2. Added classes to make styling easier. Upgraded the navigation bar to align the logo and menu items side by side.  Updated the logo color and made it's background transparent. Changed the navigation link text color, font and weight. Added opacity on links when hovered over. Changed the background color for the site. Added an image to the main element within the body and styled it to fit the width of the screen.
